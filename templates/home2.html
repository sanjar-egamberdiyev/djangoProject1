    <h2>Schools should not force children to learn a foreign language, because some students do not have a natural ability for languages.</h2>
    <p>Some children have great difficulty in organizing foreign languages, so it is not possible to force children to organize other languages. I do not agree with this opinion at all due to children should be encouraged to learn a foreign language, not to be forced to learn it and not everyone is born talented.
There is no denying that learning other languages is very beneficial for children. Knowing different languages will help increase childrenâ€™s ability to read and work in the future. For example, the most important textbooks and magazines today are in English, so Indian students who are fluent in English can have easier access to these materials, which leads to better reading outcomes. Fluency in many languages is also beneficial when people apply for a job. In addition, learning other languages can help children understand more about different traditions and cultures, which can encourage mutual understanding between people of different nationalities and promote globalization.
The most gifted children in the world could be one in a million. others achieve high results through hard work, perseverance, and many years of experience. we can see that if children can absorb a high level of interest in organizing foreign languages from an early age, then they will not have any problems in organizing other languages. According to a study conducted by the University of Denver in Poland in 14 European countries, 411 out of 552 children achieved good results in language organization. it is clear that the most important thing is the right upbringing.
In conclude, it is necessary to arouse maximum interest in languages when teaching foreign languages at school.
